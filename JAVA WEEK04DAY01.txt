some general arguments+

school - gets better system, improves efficiency, better rates of graduation, gets support from state (money)
it company - gets a good deal
tagteam - gets a good deal
state - better education system = better educated people on the job market = less unemployed people = more money for the state

browser application that can be accessed by school and tagteam members

database with all teachers and students

database tracks grades and subjects and abnormality of some students

color rating for students depending on behaviour/grades
	-> green for good students
	-> yellow for students who need assitance in some subjects
	-> red for students with bad grades and behavioral problems

color rating gets created by average grades and register entries and attendence

ensure data privacy for sharing the data with third-party organisations

school/teacher is able to see all grades and data from a student

in order to be able to share the data from a student wee need the permission (signature) from the parents

school can share students who are in yellow/red to the ngo 

as soon as a students enters yellow ask if everything is okay and offer help

prevent students to go to red as good as possible (warning system when student gets close to red)

IF a students gets to red parents and student himself get invited to principal and the teacher in which subject he has problems to discuss a solution for the problem

from time to time ngos tutors and teachers from school meet up to discuss students progress

SYSTEM FOR SCHOOL

database with student data

keeps track of students grades and behavioral abnormalities

system that puts the students based on the provided data in to the green color zones (green/yellow/red)

if we have the permission of the parents we can share the problem students data to the ngo



SYSTEM FOR NGO

gets the data from the school

puts students based on age and subject into a class

although students sit in the same class they can still get different exercises during the class

one class can have many students but only one teacher

ngos check attendence of students

classes take place either on saturdays or in the afternoons after school

in case of reexamination ngos also offer classes during the summer
